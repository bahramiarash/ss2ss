Simple solutions to solve the subjects.

In this repository I am going to publish my simple solutions on daily topics that I face during work pocess. In the last 20 years, I have been mainly involved as an IT department manager in various companies and organizations, as well as a product owner of digital products like webapps and mobile applications.

It is also my personal hobby to analyze business problems and try to find a solution to improve the business or improve it to gain better user experience or better customer experience.

During these years, some of the important views that I have gained in doing managerial, executive and technology-oriented work are:

1- Let the data speak. Beware of inaccurate data and biased analyses;

2- Don't make up your own mind about anything you hear, even from people you trust. Unless you make sure that they have thoroughly investigated the matter and are speaking without any bias. Of course, this does not mean that as a manager, you should go into every detail, but make sure that the work is carried out scientifically and operationally by experts and professionals.;
