Upon code execution, the resulting output is presented below. It is evident that the data yields fundamental yet substantial insights:

Sum: The total time expended by each stage on processing request files.
Min: The minimum time taken to process a request.
Mean: The average time allocated to processing requests within each stage.
Max: The maximum time dedicated to a request at each stage.
Iteration_count: The overall count of non-unique requests processed at each stage.
Rejected: The total count of rejected requests at each stage.
Based on our sample data, the following observations can be made from the table below:

1- The highest occurrence of rejected requests is concentrated in stages 2 and 3.

   :: This might be indicative of unclear rules within these stages.
   
   :: It is possible that personnel in the initial stage encounter challenges in request setup.

2- Stages 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate extended processing times for requests.

   :: Personnel responsible for these stages may benefit from additional training to enhance their efficiency.
   
   :: Software infrastructure issues could also be contributing to the delays.
   
Furthermore, by applying data filtering with the "specific_date" parameter, it becomes feasible to analyze data over continuous time intervals. This allows for more precise assessments of the overall process and aids in evaluating policies implemented during specific time periods.
